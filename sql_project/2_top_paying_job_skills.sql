/*
SQL shows up across the board. Itâ€™s a must-have.

Python is also huge, right alongside SQL.

R pops up frequently but less than Python.

Cloud platforms like Azure and Databricks are common too.

Some roles mention big data tools and platforms.

Skills like Tableau or Power BI appear for data visualisation.

The focus is split between coding, querying databases, and working with cloud/big data tech.
